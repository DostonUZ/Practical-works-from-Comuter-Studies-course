### Description of practical work:

I had a problem during the implementation of the task, the problem was that I used my account and I cloned new project from new account but I didnt change the account in git bash. Then I got <b>"remote: Permission to DostonUZ/P04.git denied to dostonhamrakulov"</b>. Even if I changed the user.name and user.email I could not push repository. SO here, you can find all steps which I have done until I solved the problem

I have added the title and tried to push the repository.

Finally, I had to delete <b> Git Hub account</b> from <b>Window Credential Manager</b>:

Then I logged in my new account
